# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

### Download Docker

Here is a good place to look: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

### Start the docker environment

`docker-compose up`

### Check the backend

Visit http://localhost:3000/api/ping

### Check the frontend

Visit http://localhost:3001/register

### Troubleshooting

- If the page returns an empty response, you may need to watch the docker logs.
  Sometimes, visiting the page will start the server and then take a moment to appear.
